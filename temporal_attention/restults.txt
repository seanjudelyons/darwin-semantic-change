The Python code provided outlines a semantic change detection system designed to evaluate how the meanings of words have shifted over time using different models, particularly focusing on natural language processing with neural networks.

Here's a breakdown of key components and processes in the script:

Main Components
Imports and Dependencies: The script imports various Python modules necessary for handling data, mathematical operations, logging, and deep learning tasks.
SCORE_METHOD Class: This enum defines different methods to calculate the semantic change score. Two methods are mentioned:
TIME_DIFF: Calculates change based on the time difference of word usage.
COSINE_DIST: Uses cosine distance between word embeddings to measure semantic change.
Function Definitions:
calc_change_score_time_diff and calc_change_score_cosine_dist: These functions compute the semantic change score using the specified method (time difference or cosine distance) for a word across given sentences.
get_embedding: Retrieves the word embedding from the model.
semantic_change_detection_wrapper: This is the main function orchestrating the detection process. It initializes the process, iterates over different models, and gathers results.
Utility Functions:
check_words_in_vocab: Checks if the words are present in the tokenizer's vocabulary.
get_shifts: Retrieves hardcoded semantic shift scores for words, if available.
compute_metrics: Calculates correlation metrics (Pearson and Spearman) between the computed scores and some ground truth.
Execution Block (if __name__ == "__main__"):
Sets up configurations, initializes the model, and calls semantic_change_detection_wrapper to start the evaluation.
Process Overview
Initialization: The script starts by setting up the model and configurations. It specifies paths, the number of sentences to consider, batch sizes, etc.
Model Processing: For each model, the script processes target words to detect semantic changes. It logs details like missing words, gathers relevant sentences, and computes scores using the selected method.
Output: After processing, the script calculates correlation metrics to evaluate the performance and prints the results.
Output Execution Trace
The trace shows commands related to setting up a Python environment using Conda, activating a GPU-accelerated PyTorch environment, and executing the script.
The script logs various steps such as model processing and metric calculation, indicating successful processing of words and calculation of metrics like Pearson and Spearman correlations.
This setup is typically used in research contexts where understanding language evolution is crucial. The system can be applied to various corpora to analyze how words' meanings change over time, which can be vital for linguistic studies, historical analyses, or improving language models' understanding of temporal language variations.
